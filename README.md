### W10-Configurator
 W10-Configurator project and code has been greatly improved.

### {PROJECT is in early development stage, if you don't know AutoIt language, use at your own risk.}

-Main Script has been cleaned with almost only intentional leftovers.

***DISCLAIMER***
 Too many changes have been done since last push and I did not add notes for every changes ive done because If I do, I will never finish this project before Windows 12, my free time is extremely rare so when I have some, I work on this project !

if there is any volounters, it would be extremely appreciated ! Any kind of help ^^
